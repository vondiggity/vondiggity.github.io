## Quick MTB Ride at Whiting Ranch

Just got back from a quick look at Whiting Ranch in Lake Forest, CA. It's a great place for a quick ride and the trails are in good shape from the last rains. A new rounds of storms is headed our way, so I wanted to get out before things got too wet again. 
Here's some photos I took from the ride:
