## Quick MTB Ride at Whiting Ranch

Just got back from a quick ride at Whiting Ranch in Lake Forest, CA. It’s a great spot for squeezing in a short ride, and the trails are in really good shape after the recent rains. With another round of storms headed our way, I wanted to get out there before everything got too wet again.


### Here's some photos I took from the ride:
