## RV Trip to Lone Pine and Death Valley.

Over Thanksgiving break, the family and I decided to take the travel trailer out for a quick escape to the Eastern Sierra. We packed up and took the long way to Lone Pine—intentionally. I really don’t enjoy driving through downtown LA, so instead we headed up the 15 to Barstow, then cut across Highway 58 to pick up the 395. It adds a few extra miles, but the tradeoff is absolutely worth it. The drive is calmer, and way less stressful.

We stopped in Barstow to fuel up and grab some snacks, then made the final push     to Lone Pine. We stayed at [Boulder Creek RV Resort] (https://www.bouldercreekrvresort.com), just off 395 and perfectly located near Alabama Hills and Mt. Whitney. It’s a great little park, this was our second stay and one I’d been eyeing for years. 

On our first full day, we drove up to Mammoth to check out the snow and wander around the Village. We usually visit Mammoth in the summer for mountain biking, so I was curious how winter crowds would compare. Short answer: it was way more crowded than summer. Still fun, but definitely different.

Thanksgiving Day itself took us in the opposite direction, out to Death Valley. Highway 190 is just up the road, so after a quick stop at the Eastern Sierra Visitor Center to grab maps and some info, we headed out. The weather was perfect, but the park was crowded, which makes sense given it’s prime season down there.

We ended up having Thanksgiving lunch at Furnace Creek Ranch, where they were running an all you can eat Thanksgiving buffet. Food wasn't bad and luckily, they had Coke on tap. Afterward, we did a bit of easy hiking before heading back. One thing that surprised me was seeing the RV parks near Furnace Creek closed, especially odd considering this is arguably the best time of year to be in Death Valley.

All in all, a great Thanksgiving trip: fewer freeways, big scenery, and a reminder of why the Eastern Sierra never disappoints.
